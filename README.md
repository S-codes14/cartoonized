Image cartoonized

- Backend: Python (Flask, deployed on heroku) FYI(not created by me)
- Frontend: React
- CSS Preprocessor: Sass

Note: On heroku, apps tend to go asleep if there is no traffic in 1 hour. So, first POST request may take 10-20 secs, other than that, it works relatively fast depending on the image quality.
